# C-DPSSG-CDC2023
This repository contains the code of algorithm C-DPSSG Introduced in "Switch and Conquer: Efficient Algorithms By Switching Stochastic Gradient Oracles For Decentralized Saddle Point Problems", Chhavi Sharma, Vishnu Narayanan, P. Balamurugan  

Code of algorithm C-DPSSSG is provided for logistic regression and AUC maximization.
### Requirements to run the code:  

-> Install packages mentioned in .py files       

-> Path or file of binary classification data                                                                                                                   
-> Saddle point solution files if interested in plotting the gap between the algorithm iterates and saddle point solution
### How to run the code?   

-> Simply run the command python filename.py in terminal
